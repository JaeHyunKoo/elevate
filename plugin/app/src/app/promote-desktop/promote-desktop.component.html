				<i>A new desktop training app is in development since early 2019. App is simply called "Elevate". It‚Äôs
					cross-platform. It has been triggered by "incompatibilities" between Strava & the current chrome
					extension "Elevate For Strava" (e.g. sync problems limitations). Desktop app features will match the
					chrome extension ones at the beginning. The GPS data will be imported from athletes local files and
					third-party online "connectors". You will own your data & the app!! The old chrome extension will
					remain available on Chrome Store as long as necessary. Desktop app will be available on Windows &
					Linux first. Later on MacOS (MacBook investment required). Still developed on free time.</i>
