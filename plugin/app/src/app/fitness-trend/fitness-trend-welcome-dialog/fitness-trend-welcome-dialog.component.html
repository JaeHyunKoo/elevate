<h2 mat-dialog-title>New feature important notice: "Estimated Fitness Trend" </h2>
<mat-dialog-content class="mat-body-1">

	<div>
		From now, if you don't own (or sometimes forgot) your sensors, your fitness trend can be nevertheless estimated.
		Extensively a "typical" iPhone or Android mobile user who runs the strava mobile app can now access the fitness
		trend feature without buying any external sensors üëç. Nevertheless sensors are highly recommended if you need a
		more accurate trend.
	</div>

	<div>
		Since the fitness trend is calculated on activities' stress scores, this implies that stress scores of your
		activities without sensors have to be estimated too. Currently only cycling, running and swimming activities can
		have their stress scores estimated.
	</div>

	<div>
		Estimating stress scores on cycling and running implies the below prerequisites:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Estimated <i>Cycling Power Stress Score (PSS)</i>:
				<ul>
					<li>Your <i>Cycling Functional Threshold Power (FTP)</i> must be set in <a
						[routerLink]="'/athleteSettings'" (click)="dialogRef.close()">single or dated athlete
						settings</a>. A wrong ftp
						can cause too big/low PSS scores on activities.
					</li>
					<li>The power meter data toggle
						<mat-icon [style.vertical-align]="'bottom'">flash_on</mat-icon>
						must be switched <strong>ON</strong> (on screen behind).
					</li>
					<li>
						Your weight must be set in your <a href="https://www.strava.com/settings/profile"
														   target="_blank">strava.com profile</a> allowing strava to
						estimate power data on your next cycling activities
						(required to compute <i>PSS</i>).
					</li>
					<li>
						Your cycling activities must have correct elevation data. Read Strava elevation <a
						href="https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001294564-Elevation-on-Strava-FAQs"
						target="_blank">FAQ</a> and <a

						target="_blank">Notes</a> to fix your activities if needed. A "Clear and re-sync
						activities" can be required after any fix.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Estimated Running Stress Score (RSS)</i>:
				<ul>
					<li>Your <i>Running Functional Threshold Pace</i> must be set in <a
						[routerLink]="'/athleteSettings'" (click)="dialogRef.close()">single or dated athlete
						settings</a>.
					</li>
				</ul>
